The annual Birthday Fundraiser has arrived! **TL;DR It's my birthday (April 15th) and I want to raise some funds. Skip to "How this works" if you want to join in.**

## What is this?

The last two years I have raised money for three different organizations. In 2020, it was the Central Texas Food Bank. In 2021, it was the Texas Civil Rights Project and Texas Rising from Texas Freedom Network. I wanted to keep this year focused on one organization to maximize donation impact. For 2022, I have chosen the **[Transgender Education Network of Texas](https://www.transtexas.org/) (TENT)**.

"**TENT** is an organization dedicated to furthering gender diverse equality in Texas. We work to accomplish this through education and networking in both public and private forums. Through our efforts we strive to halt discrimination through social, legislative, and corporate education."

## Why TENT?

In the US, for every $100 donated to LGBTQIA+ orgs, only 4 cents are donated to transgender led organizations. That is why I wanted to focus this year's birthday fundraising on the largest trans led, trans focused organization in the state of Texas. **TENT** works to further gender diverse equality in Texas through a racial justice lens with an intersectional approach and a focus on both education and legislative work.

In the past I've volunteered with organizations like Texas Freedom Network to fight bathroom bills in the state of Texas and thought the situation was already horrible then, but this year we have seen the greatest attack on the rights of trans Texans, children and adults. [Read more from the Texas Tribune.](https://www.texastribune.org/series/transgender-texans/) And the next legislative session in 2023 will have even more bills actively seeking to harm. 

I strongly believe that education and awareness make a difference to further advocacy in Texas. Centering the lived experience of the trans community is _critical_. I've seen it work with my own friends and family, which is why organizations like **TENT** are so crucial.

Let trans folks in Texas live.

## How this works? 

You give, I give. I'll be matching up to the first $500 in funds donated before the end of the weekend. In total, I'm aiming to raise over **$1,000** for **TENT**.

## Other wonderful organizations

Lastly, here's a list of wonderful non-profit organizations that I considered including and still wish I could:

- [The Oath](https://www.outdooristoath.org/): Created to help outdoorists create the future of outdoors through education and community for the planet, inclusion, and adventure. If you are interested, check out their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/outdooristoath/) to see what they've been up to and sign up to takee the Oath yourself (through an interactive workshop). _The outdoors will not be for everyone until it includes everyone._
- [Equality Texas](https://www.equalitytexas.org/): Works to secure full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer Texans through political action, education, community organizing, and collaboration.
- [Frontera Fund](https://fronterafundrgv.org/): A fund that provides financial support and a sense of community for those seeking abortions in the Rio Grande Valley. One example of this was recently [in the news](https://delapabb.medium.com/my-interview-with-la-frontera-funds-rockie-gonzalez-on-lizelle-herrera-s-arrest-in-starr-county-b7a747068d14). Without these local organizers, Lizelle would still be in jail. While Texas has multiple abortion funds across the state, some of the greatest need is in the RGV. There is only one clinic in the area and with SB8 and other laws options are even more limited. [Read more about the Rio Grande Valley's abortion desert in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-rio-grande-valleys-abortion-desert). _Abortion is health care. Period._
- [Fund Texas Choice](https://fundtexaschoice.org/): A fund that helps Texans equitably access abortion through safe, confidential, and comprehensive travel services and practical support. Look up an abortion fund that is local to you and part of the [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/funds/).
