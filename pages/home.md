Taylor Barnett is a Senior Community Engineer at [Transposit](https://transposit.com). She is passionate about building great developer experiences with an emphasis on empathy and inclusion within product, documentation, and other community-focused projects. 

After leaving software engineering roles at a couple of companies, Taylor led Developer Relations at [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io), an API design management platform, and worked with the developer community, SDKs, and documentation at [Keen](https://keen.io), a data analytics API company. She has spoken on developer experience (including API design), SDKs, OpenAPI, developer empathy, and building developer communities at conferences such as O'Reilly OSCON, API Specifications Conference, GlueCon, multiple API Strategy & Practices, API the Docs, AlterConf, DevRelCon, DevXcon, Hackcon, and various meetups. 

In her free time, she's either climbing rocks with friends, trying to find the funkiest sour beers, or hanging out with her corgi, [Yoda](https://instagram.com/yoda_atx), in Austin, Texas (Nʉmʉnʉʉ Sookobitʉ, Coahuiltecan, Tonkawa, and Lipan Apache ancestral lands).
