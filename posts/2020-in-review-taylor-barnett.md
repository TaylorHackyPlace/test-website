2020, what a freakin' year. I honestly don't have the energy to write about it, but I am really good at making lists. Here are some lists of things I explored, read, wrote, and spoke about in 2020...

## <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-label="Pencil icon for blog  post"></i> Blog posts:
In the last few years, I've averaged from 6 to 12 blog posts a year for work. I hit a new high with 16 this year, as well as editing and giving feedback on dozens of teammates work.

I did notice one interesting pattern: I did almost no long form writing in March and June. I blame Covid-19 and our nation's other epidemic, racism, for that. My brain was focused on things that mattered a lot more, and that's okay.

## <i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Documentation:
I worked on various new and updated docs pages for the Transposit docs. 

[Transposit Docs Update](https://transposit.com/docs)

## <i class="fab fa-twitch"></i> Streaming:
This year I figured out what Twitch actually is. I was a guest on a couple of shows this year, but I am interested in exploring streaming, including while writing code, in 2021.

## <i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> Talks:
Virtual talks, big oof. It was a rough year giving virtual talks, but I still managed to give my average number of talks. I've never wanted to do more than a talk every couple of months since I like to focus on other forms of content too. Although I'm probably going to write a couple new talks in 2021.

## <i class="fas fa-tree"></i> Texas State Parks I visited:
Normally, I'm a climber and you'll find me in Reimers Ranch Park on most weekends along with a few out of state climbing trips. (And no Mexican NYE celebrations in El Potrero Chico.) But in order to be extra catious with Covid-19, I decided to stop climbing until later in 2021 since normally it involves closely interacting with climbing partners outside of my household. Instead, I picked up more hiking and camping.
